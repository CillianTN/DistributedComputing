# DistributedComputing Project

## Overview

The Distributed Computing project provides a secure messaging platform, enabling encrypted communication between clients and a server. Utilizing SSL sockets for encryption, 
it ensures that messages are transmitted securely over the network. The project is split into multiple components, including client-side applications (both CLI and GUI versions) 
and a server-side application, to manage connections and message exchanges.
